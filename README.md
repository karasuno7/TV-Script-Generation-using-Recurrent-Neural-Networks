# TV-Script-Generation-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
In this project, I've generated my own [Simpsons](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) TV scripts using RNNs.
Only a part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons is used in this code.
The Neural Network built will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
